In this lab you will build a version of the carousel. You can choose whether to use the images of food or of animals or pull photos from another location.

Make sure you have viewed the obfuscated code and understand how the carousel should work and be sure to write your pseudocode first.

You will use an .on(click) event to navigate between pictures (backwards and forwards) without voting(thatâ€™s bonus)

Bonus: You will use the change event to give a ranking to the photos between 1 and 5. The user should be forwarded to the next image after voting.
